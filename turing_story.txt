I came to Turing seeking not only a different career--I wanted a system's reboot. I have spent the bulk of my past years exploring the art of balancing responsibilities/goals with praxis. Turing offered me a unique opportunity to not only develop strong technical skills that would prove to be the foundation of a new professional charter, it offered me a chance to do so in a community-oriented environment that valued people as PEOPLE. I came lugging with me years of self-analysis, but the unique program at Turing--which focuses as much on soft skills as technical ones--allowed me to grow even more self-aware, in such a way that I could finally move  forward--instead of stay paralyzed in anlysis of the past and present.
